# SteelHack Project - Carbon Efficient Data Center Location Selection

**Harness the power of data to optimize your cloud infrastructure's environmental impact.**

This repository provides tools and insights to help you select the most carbon-efficient data center 
location for your cloud workloads. By leveraging the Electricity Maps API, we offer a comprehensive 
approach to understanding and predicting the carbon footprint of different regions. 

Key Features:
- **Data Center Carbon Footprint Analysis**: Utilize Electricity Maps API to retrieve historical and 
predicted carbon intensity data for various data center locations.
- **Optimization Tools**: Employ algorithms to identify optimal data center locations based on carbon 
footprint and other factors (e.g., cost, performance).

**Getting Started:**
1. Install **uvicorn** and **fastapi** requirement using pip.

*Run uvicorn ASGI server*

`uvicorn main:app --reload`

**Contributing:**
We welcome contributions to improve the project.
